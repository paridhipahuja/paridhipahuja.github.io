        INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
    </h1>
    <p>
Cryptography is technique of securing information and communications through use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it. Thus preventing unauthorized access to information. The prefix “crypt” means “hidden” and suffix graphy means “writing”. 
*Features Of Cryptography are as follows:</p>
<p>

    Confidentiality,Integrity,Non-repudiation,Authentication
</p>

        Substitution Technique in Cryptography Substitution :-Technique is a classical encryption technique where the characters present in the original message are replaced by the other characters or numbers or by symbols. If the plain text (original message) is considered as the string of bits, then the substitution technique would replace bit pattern of plain text with the bit pattern of cipher text
        Substitution Technique:

    <ol>
        <li> Caesar Cipher</li>
        
        <li> Monoalphabetic Cipher</li>
        <li> Playfair Cipher </li>
        <li> Hill Cipher </li>
        <li> Polyalphabetic Cipher</li>
        <li> One-Time Pad Monoalphabetic Cipher</li> 
    </ol>
    <h2>

        MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY
    </h2>
<p> ASYMMETRIC(Asymmetric Key Cryptography is called as Public-key cryptography. In this approach, 
Receiver will use Private Key to Decrypt and Sender will use Public Key Encrypt)</p>
<p> SYMMETRIC(Symmetric key cryptography is also called Private key Cryptography. In this approach, both 
the sender and receiver will use the same key for encrypting and decrypting the message.)</p>
<p> HASH(A hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that garbles data and makes it 
unreadable)</p>
<h3>AES(ADVANCE ENCRYPTION STANDARD)</h3>
<p> AES is a symmetric-key algorithm for securing sensitive but unclassified material by U.S. government agencies .AES is an iterated blocked cipher, which works by repeating the same operation multiple times.</p>
<h3>DES(DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD)</h3>
<p> The algorithm is designed to encipher and decipher blocks of data consisting of 64 bits under control of a 56-bit key.DES is the archetypal block cipher – an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits and transforms it into a cipher text bit string of the same length.</p>

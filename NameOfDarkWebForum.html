            INTRODUCTION TO DARK WEB FORUM
        </h1>
<p> A dark web forum is a platform where users can freely discuss matters connected to illicit goods or services like drug trafficing,child pronography, hacking, data leaks,racist, and extremist content and more. These forums offer users different types of memberships such as VIP ,Premium or Moderator. Since active forums users are often wanted by law enforcement or security agencies , monitoring them offers useful information to stop these cyber criminals in their tracks.</p>

    NAME OF DARK WEB FORUM:
    DREAD
</B>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>

    INTRODUCTION TO DREAD
</h2>
<p> It was founded on 15 FEB 2018.It used english as its main language.It had a statistical growth of 15k with in the first three months.The main admin of Dread forum u/hugbunter/,has stated that they do not intendto offer paid memberships at any point.Following a month of down time from the 23rd of April, the platform was redeveloped to be a lot more stable, with the backbone and UI completely re-imagined to allow for more flexibility, based on the mistakes that were made in the first iteration.”</p>
<p> Dark Web markets are based on the eBay model of online retail. “Dread is an onion based free speech platform and forum, where you can post, comment and share among tonnes of different communities.It was developed with both privacy and usability in mind, choosing to stick to a common user interface to match the likes of Reddit, but without the added security issues that are involved with the use of JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>

        TRADING
    </h2>
<p> Dark Web markets are the number one destination for cybercriminals who want to sell malware, ransomware-as-a-service, and databases of breached data. A lot of the breached data that can be purchased through Dark Web markets for cryptocurrency is very dangerous in the wrong hands. Criminals are selling credit card numbers, usernames and passwords, and “fullz”-- the information that’s needed to engage in identity and financial fraud. Almost everything else you can imagine that’s illegal is sold in Dark Web markets too.</p>
<p> Most illegal drug dealers online work differently. The operators of Dark Web markets are separate from their vendors. And of course, their sites can only be accessed through Tor and I2P. In real life, Dark Web markets work similarly to eBay. Just think of them as “if eBay was for bad stuff.” Anyone who follows the right steps can set up an account to sell illegal things on a Dark Web market, or conversely, to buy those things as a customer. And the same sites with vendors who sell illegal drugs also have vendors who sell breached financial data, phishing kits, and other cybercrime weapons. It’s my job to observe it, take notes. I also see that these Dark Web market vendors and buyers are playing a dangerous game. Because although it’s more difficult for law enforcement to investigate Dark Web crime, the cops are often successful. Using the Dark Web is no guarantee that you won’t get caught.</p>
<h2>

    SHARING
</h2>
<p> It is platform used where you can post , comment and share information in various different communities without fear of censorship.The forum is thought to have emerged after reddit banned a no. of reddits related to darnet market discussions. This allowed dread forum to grow a large uer base more quickly than many others darknet forums. The forum, which has 500 posts per day and 700 sub- dreads is the known feature in depth guidelines to manufacturing of illegal drugs, stolen data and announce major marketplaces.</p>
<h2>

    CRYPTO CURRENCY
</h2>
<p> Cryptocurrencies are popular on the dark web because they provide a convenient method of obfuscating identities and transaction details. NFT are generated and transactions are in forms of hashes which are difficult to decrypt.</p>

<p> DREAD SEIZURE:DDoS activity affecting the entire Tor network had impacted DarkMarket, among others. The administrator of Dread even initiated a thread accusing marketplace owners of organizing such attacks against their competitors or even performing retaliatory attacks. The administrator said that DDoS attacks on the Tor network would not only harm the intended target but also damage the whole of the cybercriminal community. DDoS activity between cybercriminals is not uncommon, but the fact that DarkMarket was already being targeted and struggling to remain online before its seizure may have dulled the impact of the takedown as the community was used to it being offline for long periods. </p>

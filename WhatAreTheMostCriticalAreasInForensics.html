            WHAT  ARE MOST CRITICAL INVESTIGATION AREAS IN FORENSICS
        </h1>
        <h2>

            DRAWBACKS
        </h2>

        <ol>

           <li> evidence collection:not collecting  enough of the sample,not obtaining the standards of comparison,not maintaining the integrity of the evidence.</li>
           <li> evidence analysis: encryption, time stamp,covert channel,dynamic increase in volume,contamination of sample.</li>
           <li> evidence investigation:testimonies in misleading ,data breach,tampering,cyber attacks.</li>
           <li>  evidence report generation: corrupted evidence,data loss, loss of report.</li>
        </ol>


<h2>

    how we can cover it?
</h2>
<ol>

    <li> preserve the scene with minimal contamination and disturbance of physical evidence. </li>
    <li> ensure that no unauthorized person(s) enters the crime scene and causes contamination.</li>
    <li> The integrity of evidence is best maintained when the item is kept in its original condition as found at the crime site.</li>
    <li> Most evidence should be stored at room temperature, unless it is liquid evidence, in which case it should be re* reliable instrument can generate consistent results. More specifically, when an instrument is applied to target subjects more than once, an investigator can expect to obtain results that are quite similar or even identical each time.</li>
     <li>   frigerated and packaged in a sterile glass or plastic bottle.</li>
</ol>


<h2>

    solutions
</h2>
<ol>

    <li>  increasing the system security </li>
    <li> limited access of the system to the people, not giving access to everyone</li>
    <li> sensitive information should be kept secure hidden in folders</li>
    <li> upating the system regularly</li>
    <li> using write blockers </li>
</ol>
